Write a decorator validate_positive(func) that ensures the function it wraps is only called with positive numbers as arguments. Apply it to a function square_root(x) that computes the square root of a number.

Input Format

A single integer or float x that represents the number whose square root is to be calculated.

Constraints

-10^6 ≤ x ≤ 10^6 The input must be a positive number; otherwise, a ValueError is raised.

Output Format

If the input is valid, return the square root of x as a float. If the input is invalid (non-positive), raise a ValueError with the message: "Input must be a positive number".
