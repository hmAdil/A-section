Write a generator prime_numbers(limit) that yields all prime numbers up to a given limit.

Input Format

A single integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10,000), where n is the upper bound (inclusive) up to which prime numbers must be generated.

Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 10,000 The generator should yield each prime number in ascending order.

Output Format

The function should yield prime numbers, one by one, in ascending order and store it in a list -> list of all primes up to the n.
